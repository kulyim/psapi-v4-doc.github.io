    "Get information on a specific child of a collection. This endpoint does not require authentication. 
    The ability to retrieve a specific child of a collection is dependent on the visibility and access 
    options set to the parent collection. If a user does not have access to the collection then they 
    will not be able to view a specific child of a collection. Some fields will be returned as null 
    if the user does not have ownership access. The fields that are impacted are 'created_at', 
    'access_id', modified_at'. If a child is not found with the id then a 404 error will be thrown."
