  description: >-
    "Get a collection's children. This endpoint does not require authentication. Accessing a 
    collection's children depends on the visibility and access rights of the collection and if the 
    user has permissions to view it. If a user does not have permission to access the children then 
    a permission error will be thrown. The endpoint will return all galleries and collections 
    contained in the specified collection. Certain fields will be returned back as null if the user 
    does not have ownership access. Unlike getting the children of a gallery, collections can only 
    exist under ONE collection and not multiple collections. Per_page and page MUST BOTH be set in 
    order for pagination to work."
