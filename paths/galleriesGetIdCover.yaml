    "Retrieves the first four assets in a given gallery. This endpoint does not require 
    authentication. The assets are returned only if the user has access to the gallery. Insufficient
    permissions will result in an error. An optional collection_id query parameter is available to 
    set the context of the collection that the gallery is in. That is because a gallery can exist 
    in multiple collections and if a gallery exists in both a private and a public collection then 
    a user will always be thrown an error. Setting the query parameter to have the id of the public 
    collection will allow the user to access the cover of the gallery."
