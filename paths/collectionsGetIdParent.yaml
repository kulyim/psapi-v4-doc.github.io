    "Get a collection's parent. This endpoint does not require authentication. The ability to view a
    collection's parent is dependent on whether or not the user has access to the collection. Some 
    fields will be returned as null if the user does not have ownership access. The fields are 
    'created_at' and 'modified_at', and 'access_id'. If a parent is not found then the data object 
    will be empty."
