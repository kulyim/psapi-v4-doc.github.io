    'This endpoint does not require authentication. It will retrieve all of the media contained in
    the gallery. Standard visibility and access permissions apply. If a user does not have access to
    the contents of the gallery then they will be thrown an error. If a gallery is contained in
    multiple collections then an optional collection_id query parameter can be used to specify the 
    collection that the gallery is a child of. This way, you can still access the media of a gallery 
    should you lack permissions due to the parent to child relationship in one collection versus 
    another collection. (Ex. Collection A is completely private and Collection B is public. Gallery 
    C exists in both collections. If you do not specify the collection_id then you will always be 
    denied access. Passing in the collection_id of Collection B to this endpoint will now give you 
    ability to access media in Gallery C because the context of Collection B is public.)'
